Since I'm a Maven junkie, I found a plugin to build to Android.  Yeah. 

1. Start with these instructions:
   http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/GettingStarted

   Namely, 
   	(1) Download the Android SDK
   	(2) Run the setup; download the latest device profiles (2.1/ version 7)
   	(3) Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD)


2. Start your emulators!

   mvn android:emulator-start -Dandroid.emulator.avd=[Name of the AVD you created]


3. Compile and deploy that shit!  

   Any changes to .aidl files or anything under res/ require 'mvn process-resources' to generate 
   the Java stubs.

   mvn package android:deploy # Will package and deploy the app to your running emulator.


4. Use 'adb logcat' to watch log messages on the emulator
